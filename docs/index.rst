ChemLG is a smart and massive parallel molecular library generator for chemical and materials sciences.


Github Repository: https://github.com/hachmannlab/chemlg

Program Version: 0.9

Release Date: Aug 20, 2020




With contributions by:
Gaurav Vishwakarma (UB): Genetic Algorithm, Code Redesign and Maintenance
Janhavi Abhay Dudwadkar (UB): Jupyter GUI


Code Design
+++++++++++

ChemLG is developed in the Python 3 programming language and uses OpenBabel and its Python extension, Pybel for handling molecules. The development follows a strictly modular and object-oriented design to make the overall code as flexible and versatile as possible. ChemLG can be run on a single core or in parallel on multiple cores. For the parallel execution, MPI4Py is also required along with OpenBabel as dependencies of ChemLG. 

Installation and Dependencies
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It is highly recommended that a virtual environment is used to run ChemLG. The virtual environment and ChemLG and its dependencies can be installed as:

.. code:: bash

    conda create --name my_chemlg_env python=3.6
    source activate my_chemlg_env
    conda install -c conda-forge openbabel
    conda install -c anaconda mpi4py
    pip install chemlg
